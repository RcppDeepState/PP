Description: The PP package includes estimation of (MLE, WLE, MAP) person
    parameters for the 1,2,3,4-PL model and the GPCM (generalized partial
    credit model). The parameters are estimated under the assumption that the
    other parameters are known and fixed. The package could be useful when
    items from an itempool/itembank with known item parameters are administered
    to a new population of testtakers and an ability estimation for every
    testtaker is needed.

#'@return The function returns a list with the estimation results and pretty much everything which has been submitted to fit the model. The estimation results can be found in \code{OBJ$resPP}. The core result is a number_of_persons x 2 matrix, which contains the ability estimate and the SE for each submitted person.

#' Note that the returned \code{respm} in \code{resPP$ipar$respm} is always a matrix which contains the extracted responses and not a data.frame - if a data.frame was submitted in the first place! Any further columns are stored in \code{resPP$ipar$rest}.
